# The Design and Operation of Energy Systems Team at VTT - who are we?

*'Design and Operation of Energy Systems' team at VTT Finland is developing state-of-the-art open optimization models for 100% sustainable energy systems*



We operate at the sweet spot between where energy system expertize meets mathematics and programming. Our team consist of nine researchers with years of experience on creating cutting-edge energy system modelling. Our work is in research projects for the benefit of the Finnish and European public authorities, as well as the Nordic industry.
